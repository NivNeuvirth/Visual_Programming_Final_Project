# Visual Programming Final Project - H.I.T

## Overview 
Welcome to the Self Checkout System project implemented visually using visual programming languages like Statecharts and LSCs. This project focuses on representing the functionalities and interactions of a self-checkout system through visual diagrams and models. Additionally, a graphical user interface (GUI) has been developed using Python, utilizing the generated code from the Statecharts to create an interactive interface for users to simulate the self-checkout process. Explore the project to understand the visualization of complex system behaviors and the integration of visual programming with traditional programming paradigms.
